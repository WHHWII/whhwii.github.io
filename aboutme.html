    <p>I developed an interest in making games in middleschool, and started trying to teach myself with youtube videos. 
        It never amounted to anything, but in highschool I took some programming classes and feel in love with Python. 
        I made a series of text based games like blackjack, chess, and battleship,  and a couple of hiliriously out of scope attempts at a rougulikes in PyGame.
        After I graduated I had a rough sense of wanting to make games, but had doubts about being able to make a living doing it, and couldnt afford college at the time. 
        I waffled around with different game engines and projects with freinds, trying to make several different MMO's and Dungeon crawlers in Roblox, but all failed. 
        Depite the alformentioned love with python, I wasnt sure if programing was really wanted to do.
