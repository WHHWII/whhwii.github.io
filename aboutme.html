                    I developed an interest in making games in middle school, and started trying to teach myself with youtube videos.
                    I didnt really start learning until highschool though, where I took some programming classes for Python and Java and fell in love.
                    In these classes, I made a series of text based games like blackjack, chess, and battleship, and a couple of wild\ly out of scope attempts at roguelikes in PyGame.
                </p>
                <p>
                    After I graduated I had a rough sense of wanting to make games, but had doubts about being able to make a living doing it, and couldn't afford college at the time.
                    I waffled around with different game engines, languages, and projects with friends, trying to make several different MMOs and Dungeon crawlers in JavasScript or Roblox (Lua), but all died, again due to being wildly out of scope.
                    After a few years, I decided I needed to go to school to become the developer I wanted to be, and thankfully was better able to afford it at the time.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Since then, I have made several games for school projects, game jams, have worked on mods for Risk of rain 2 and Terraria, and have become skilled with Unity and C#.
                    Over the years, I have found that I learn quickly, and that my greatest strength is my persistence.
                    While in some ways torturous, the willingness to pour over API and slave away at a problem has helped me get ahead and make projects a reality.
                    Additionally, my long string of dropped projects initially viewed as failures, have given me a strong sense of scope, essential planning skills, and a miscellaneous assortment of design and art skills.

                    I have recently graduated from FullSail University with a degree in Game Development and am working on a small <a href="projects/gravediver.html">autochess game </a> with a friend, as well as a <a href="projects/fisherman.html">modded character for Risk Of Rain 2</a>, while I look for an industry position.
