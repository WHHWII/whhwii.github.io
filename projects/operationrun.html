    <p> Operation run is a school project that I made with a team of 4 others. The project spanned two months.</p>
    <p>
        The Concept for the game is that when you kill an enemy,
        you get their unique weapon, and must use each weapon to collect 4 gems and
        finish each level as fast as possible.
