    <p> I made a 3D render using OpenGl in 2 months for a school project</p>
    <p> The first month was focused exclusivley on the renderer itself and was done solo, and in the second month i joined a team of 2 others, where we used my renderer to create a galaga clone</p>
    <p> The renderer used Gateware as a basis for tracking controls and library management.</p>
